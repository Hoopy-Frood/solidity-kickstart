# solidity-kickstart

Crowdfunding Solidity project with React/Next.JS frontend with the improvement of allowing contributers to have a say of how the funds are spent.  

This project follows a course on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/overview) with some slight modifications.

### Todos
1. An approver (contributer) can contibute multiple times. This will make approversCount increase without allowing the approver to approve request multiple times.  This needs to be modified
2. Approvers can contribute any amount but only gets one vote. A weighted mechanism can be considered.
3. Change to not use metamask and use Ethereum Provider
